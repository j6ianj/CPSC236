For this yahtzee game the user is given an initial roll and gets the decision to reroll certain die up to 3 times. The die uses an array to count for the random number that would display to the user, once the user is finished they get to put what they want their roll scored as. Real yahtzee has an upper and lower section but for this one it has every die scored and the yahtzee scored.
